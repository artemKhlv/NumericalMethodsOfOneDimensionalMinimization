# Numerical Methods Of One Dimensional Minimization
Numerical methods of one-dimensional minimization solving problems of one-dimensional minimization by numerical methods.

## Task:
It is required to find the absolute minimum of a function of one variable y = f(x)on the segment [a, b], where the function is unimodal. That is, find a point x = [a,b] such that f(x) = min f(x), x ∈ [a,b]
